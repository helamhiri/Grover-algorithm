# Grover-algorithm
 
Grover's algorithm demonstrates the quantum advantage in unstructured search problems.
The oracle manipulated in this algorithm is the oracle that adds a negative phase to a particular state.
We first use it to flip the amplitudes of the solution states then we use it in the diffuser (for state 0) to reflect all amplitudes above the average amplitude.
